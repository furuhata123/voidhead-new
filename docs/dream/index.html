            <p>It possibly has some connection to one of my previous dreams. My mon came to a place like a high school classroom, to give a speech out of no reason, it was like in a parent meeting. A classmate asked me who is she, and why is everything is in her charge. I probably asked her for money or buying stuff in public, but she refused, and said sometimes I even spent nearly 9k yuan on internet fees one day. I came back to my seat but didn&#39;t feel ashamed, rather a little bit secretly pleased. Then there was a person who resembled my high school class teacher gave us a long lecture about respecting other&#39;s parents, because one student left a message online for someone else&#39;s dad saying &#39;What&#39;s your relationship between you and your child&#39;s secret? (redacted for privacy)&#39; He was to investigate parents&#39; view towards child&#39;s secret, but this amibiguous question infuriated the dad. Next, I dreamed that someone confessed to me, asking if I wanted to get closer to them or something like that. This person has a younger brother. Later I was hiking on the snowy plain, actually I was climbing stairs on a semi-opened building. The route design is bad, I had to climb to the other side of building on the half way.</p>

            <p>I dreamed of being in a place like hospital and school, the hallway was quiet narrow, and each floor only had one classroom and bathroom. Walking through there is like playing a horror game without safe zone. I didn&#39;t feel scread though, since the protagonist is probably my dad. Before this I dreamed of something really realistic.</p>

            <p>I dreamed of playing game with friends, but it&#39;s so laggy. And there were stray cats under the raised floor of the house. There was a relative living in the same neibourhood and they gave me some vegetables.I also dreamed of somewhere like the classrooms from my elementary, and something about web design?</p>

            <p>I dreamed of driving home with my uncle, parents, cousin(my sister) ,my sister&#39;s friend and two other people, maybe grandpa too. It was uncle who was driving. We went to the clothes store. During the drive, the two other people in the car were arguing about something. Finally, we arrived at home, and grandma was there, I gave my mom&#39;s glasses to grandma. Then me and my father, uncle, mom and sister were driving to leave again. However, one of the two other people suddenly chasesd after to ask, nearly beg, to give them a ride. This person is pretty vague, but I feel like it was my ex.</p>

            <p>At first, it was in a school setting, but it was winding like a maze. And you have to reach a end point. There was a poster of LeBron James. Then I dreamed of road hiking which I possibly had always heared of when I was a kid. There were a person with yellow short hair walking with another person who has white long hair. Occationally, I dreamed of garbages on the roadside. The white haired person was waving hands, but I thought they have stolen the ghost&#39;s spider, because the way they waving hands looked like a spider. The yellow haired person seemed a bit shy. </p>

            <p>I dreamed of playing Salmon Run, and I was using grizzco slosher, but my teammates were unable to cooperate well. I had to run around the map to clear the salmonids alone. Then I dreamed of playing a event match in collaboration with a band, but it was actually just paint the turfs in a supermarket. Somehow I went to the bathroom, someone opened the door and asked what did I want, but I was in a hurry and anxious, so I directly shut the door without answering. The bathroom was kind of dirty. I can&#39;t remember if I managed to take a dump or not.</p>

            <p>I was in some dimly lit place like hotel or our old house, furniture piled up in the hallway. It seemed there were some problems with gardening, or school. Then I dreamed of eye care.</p>

            <p>A dream full of chaotic school scenes. I possibly dreamed of a classmate from my high school, who I thought was cute and had dreamed of her several times before, with her boyfriend? Then I wore a sub-culture outfit designed by a short hair student who looked like a typical student from China&#39;s Academy of Art, I have no idea how we knew each other. The clothes was light pink and oversized, covering the butt. She said it looks nice. Maybe she was referring to that unfashinable, old-school style. She also brought me blue jeans, and persuaded me to join some event with her. There were all fashinable people like her. I kept trying hard to think if there were any hairdressing schools nearby, so I can pretend I was a student of here.</p>

            <p>I dreamed about many stuffs. First was the things I was thinking before sleeping. Then there was some place like theme park. And it got vulgar but funny. Like, the genitals of a cactus is also a cactus. I remember clearly, we were in something like tour bus, the cactus was like an animal in nature reserve, running in the distance. Suddenly someone yelled &#39;Look! The small cactus is gonna falling off!&#39; But it just drooped down. It was the genitals of cactus, the color was very specific: the grey from yellow (or blue?) added skin&#39;s green. I was chased by it later, but I ran into ice or fire themed area, according to pokemon type chart. Subsequently, I dreamed of a friendly person, who took me to go through some formalities, I saw bunch of work permission stuffs, seemed like students from South Africa, Laos and Vietnam can legally work with this. Also I was in a noisy residental area, looked like the community of Chinatown in foreign countries.</p>

            <p>One of the few times I dreamed about something felt more like university life. I was learning a lot of courses to catch up and even taking courses I have already passed in order to improve my grades. But otherwise it felt more like high school. It was probably the first time I would emphathized with &#39;bad student&#39;. I felt jealous when the teacher said, &#39;why is your handwriting so ugly and sloppy, while XX&#39;s handwriting is so beautiful and never messy?&#39; The teacher even got angry over a student who bought a craft kit. I don&#39;t know why, but I felt ashamed about it.</p>

            <p>I had a long dream today, and most of it is uncomfortable. At first, I dreamed of being brought to a beach by a teacher with several other students, it felt like sexual assult, but I can&#39;t remember details, maybe I helped teacher apply oil on body. I feel like we are at most elementary students, or middle scool? Then I was locked up in a dark room with someone like a sibling, we figured out the person who shut us in was a policeman, so we used his transmitter to call other police in and saved. Although the protagonist were &#39;us&#39;, it felt like playing a third-person horror/detective game, I didn&#39;t feel too disturbed. Later I was on the street, a shapeless arch suddenly appeared before me, leading to a scene that looked like an animation, somewhat resembling my memories of leaving elementary school in the 90s and 00s. I was walking on the street, I can&#39;t remember, anyway my model parts always fell off. A piece that is clearly armor paart was picked up by someone, and they asked me if this is psyche bug/worm (it does look like a bug) Finally I felt like I was about to wake up, but it was as if I was paralyzed and cound&#39;t fully awaken. Sentences flashed through my mind like I was reading wikipedia articles. Dream-induced photosensitive epilepsy (paralysis? I had trouble distinguishing between these two words in my dream) is a type of photosensitive epilepsy, but the triggers are flashing scenes and intense sentences (?) in the dream.</p>

            <p>I dreamed of waiting for bus at the bus terminal, buying a ticket at the ticket machine but no matter what, I couldn&#39;e select the right starting and ending, all the station names likked so similar. The public lockers were very dirty and sticky with a sugary smell. Then I was watching TV, and the news reported that a curled-up human skeleton had been found at the bus terminal, showing footage of the skeleton directly, where you could see that the hand parts are still had flesh on. However, the skeleton suddenly stood up and approached the camera, and I wasen&#39;t scared because I knew he had always been alive. But what I didn&#39;t expect was that his genitals also had flesh on, just brazently displayed on TV like that, and the signal got cut off. Somehow I ended up on a bus, gazing out the window while browsing online and seeing things like someone writing the two big characters &#39;foot slipped (脚滑)&#39; on building at heights that no human could possibly reach, or someone drawing terrifying, grotesque faces on the wall, not the kind of fluid, aesthetical graffiti, but more like the product of a psychotic episode. The scenes outside the window seemed like something I&#39;d seen in childhood.</p>

            <p>Another dream. Something horrifying. Lately I have been dreaming a lot about an old-fashined school in 1960s style, with a boiler room, and even the scenes are almost in black and white. I dreamed that we were baking bread and firing porcelain inside it, this part gave me a weird feeling, like experiencing someone elses&#39;s memories. Later on, voilent things always occur in my dream, like my teeth getting completely shattered, I can even feel the sensation of the broken teeth piling up in my mouth and the metallic taste of blood.</p>

            <p>I dreamed of studying at a very secluded church school in the mountains, where you even had to set up your own heating system. The principal was an elderly woman, a really kind person. I took water from the school&#39;s heating system to fill up my toys, like a water gun or such, while playing on my phone. Then I saw someone insulting the church online, and right below, I saw a believer posted a rough, shiny GIF in 90s style, with text about Matthew, Jehovah, and the Hews or something like that.</p>
