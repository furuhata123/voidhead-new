      <p>This solution works well, but I don't want to mark my excerpts manually. I feel pretty strongly that the content of the site should be kept as free as possible from technical implementation details. This feels like a good principle, and will also make the content as portable as possible.
Another limitation of this solution is that the excerpt generated will be extracted from the raw content, rather than the rendered page. I use Markdown for my posts, so the excerpts I get using the built-in functionality will be snippets of the unprocessed Markdown source. Stripping Markdown formatting from text is a lot trickier than e.g. stripping HTML, as there is no common formatting of control characters etc. I'm sure there are clever regular expressions out there that solves this, but I feel more confident stripping out HTML. Another common approach is to manually run the excerpt through the markdown-it processor used by Eleventy, but I always thought that felt a bit clunky and unnecessary. The page will be processed by markdown-it as part of the site rendering anyway, why do it again just to generate an excerpt?</p>
